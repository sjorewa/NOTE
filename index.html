Hey [parvati],

I still remember how everything started on 7th Jan... Like Its funny becoz it began so simply.. jus a follow request 😭 At that time, I didnt know it would turn into something this meaningful.

Later I found out u were testing me, texting from ur alt account just to understand what kind of person I really was. Honestly, when u told me the truth, it made me smile, becoz it showed me that u were careful about who u let into ur life. nd somehow, instead of pushing me away, that honesty made me want to know u more.

As we talked more, our conversations became more natural nd frequent. You started opening up slowly, sharing parts of urself that weren’t easy to talk about. I could sense that u had been through things that made it hard for u to trust again. Well I didnt want to rush anything... I just wanted to be someone u could feel safe talking to.

Somewhere along the way, without even realizing it, I started caring about you more deeply i just fell for you nd i didn't even realise it. It wasn’t sudden or dramatic... it just happened naturally, through late conversations, small moments, nd understanding each other little by little.

Maybe You knew how I felt before we were officially together, nd I respected that u werent ready then. What mattered to me wasnt forcing a label, but being there for u. nd thats why 30th Jan felt special 🎀 not becoz it happened fast, but becoz it felt earned, real, and honest. The moment u accepted me wasn’t just the start of a relationship, it felt like trust being built step by step.

What I admire most about u is how naturally kind and caring u are. Sometimes I genuinely stop and think about how lucky I am to have someone like u in my life. u don’t just say u care... you show it in small, consistent ways that mean more than big gestures ever could... Like babe your soo good for me 😭

Even when things aren’t easy for u, you still make time for me. The fact that u stay connected, give me ur time, nd make an effort even when u don’t always have your own phone says a lot about the kind of person u r. It makes me feel valued in a way thats hard to explain...

These days my exams are going on, nd since 11th February Ive mostly been offline.. I mean Im off since 11th.. Still, u text me every day, wishing me luck, checking on me, sending voice notes jus so I don’t feel alone in the middle of all the stress. Those small things might look simple from outside, but to me they mean a lot. They remind me that someone is genuinely thinking about me.

nd honestly, its not just ur care... its everything abt u. The way u carry urself, the warmth in ur voice, nd Yeahh, how unbelievably beautiful gorgeous and sweet u are too. But what makes u truly beautiful to me isnt just how u look... its the softness nd sincerity behind it.🙌🏻

Being with u feels calm nd real, like I dont have to pretend to be someone else. nd thats rare.

Well I wont pretend that long distance is always easy. There are times when I wish I could just talk to u face to face instead of through a screen,hug you tight, kiss u all the day, sleep with you while cuddling u...or be there in the small moments that couples usually share without thinking. Sometimes the distance feels real.. especially when life gets busy or when I have exams nd cant be online as much as I want. 😭

But what surprises me is how you make the distance feel smaller... Well yahh I'm saying this again buttt..... Even during my exams, when Ive been mostly offline since 11th February, u still text me every day, wishing me luck, sending voice notes, and reminding me that ur there. Those small things mean more than u probably realize. They make me feel supported even when we’re far apart.

I think long distance shows something important... it shows effort. We dont stay connected becoz its easy, we stay connected beckz we want to. nd knowing that u choose to give ur time nd care, even when its not convenent, convenint, convenient ahh fuck, yaa so that makes me appreciate u even more.


Sometimes I imagine how simple things would feel if we were in the same place.. talking without a screen, laughing together, sharing normal moments, hugging eachother, kissing till we fall asleep, fucking.. ahem... But until then, I’m grateful for what we already have, becoz even through distance, what we share feels real nd strong.

Before I end this, theres one thing I want u to understand clearly... What I feel for u isnt temporary excitement, nd it isnt something I say lightly. It grew slowly..... from a follow request on 7th January, to conversations, to trust, to 30th January becoming one of the most meaningful dates in my life.

uve shown me care in ways that r quiet but powerful. Uve chosen me even after everything you’ve been through. nd that trust means more to me than u might ever fully know..

Idk what life will bring in the future. Idk how many challenges we'll face or how many changes will come. But I do know this... Im grateful that our paths crossed. Im grateful u tested me, opened up to me, nd gave me a chance to stand beside u.

No matter where life takes us, the time we share right now is real. And thats something distance, time, or anything else can never erase.

Happy Valentine’s Day, my soni.🎀

Always yours,
[ Jay ]
